## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

### 1.1 Project Overview
Our application, "ST1507 DSAA: Predictive Text Editor", helps Heatherthorn County restore deteriorated newspaper editions from the 1950s-1960s. The system uses prefix trie data structures for predictive text analysis and restores damaged text where OCR has failed (asterisk '*' characters).

### 1.2 Core Functionality
The application provides two main operational modes:
- **Construct/Edit Trie:** Build and manage prefix tries with keyword insertion, deletion, search, and file I/O operations
- **Predict/Restore Text:** Restore damaged text using wildcard matching and frequency-based word prediction

**Additional Features:**
- Bryan's Feature 1: Typo Correction Suggestions using Levenshtein distance
- Bryan's Feature 2: Enhanced Pattern Search with regex-like functionality  
- Joel's Feature 1: First & Last Word Auto-Complete
- Joel's Feature 2: Top N Most Frequent Words analysis

## 2. USER GUIDELINES

### 2.1 Starting the Application
1. Open Anaconda Prompt
2. Navigate to project directory
3. Execute: `python main.py`
4. Main menu displays with options 1-7

**[SCREENSHOT 2: Application startup in Anaconda Prompt]**

### 2.2 Construct/Edit Trie (Option 1)
**Key Commands:**
- `+ <word>` - Add keyword with default frequency
- `+ <word>,<freq>` - Add keyword with specified frequency  
- `- <word>` - Delete keyword
- `? <word>` - Search and display frequency
- `#` - Display trie structure
- `@` - Write trie to file
- `~` - Read keywords from file
- `=` - Export all keywords
- `!` - Help menu
- `\` - Exit to main menu

**[SCREENSHOT 3: Construct/Edit Trie interface with commands]**

### 2.3 Predict/Restore Text (Option 2)
**Key Commands:**
- `~` - Load keywords from file
- `$` - List wildcard pattern matches
- `?` - Restore word using best match
- `&` - Restore text file (all matches)
- `@` - Restore text file (best matches)

Example: `$c*t` returns "cat (150)", "cut (89)", "cot (23)"

### 2.4 Extra Features
All four extra features integrate seamlessly with the core trie system, providing enhanced functionality for typo correction, advanced pattern matching, auto-completion, and frequency analysis.

## 3. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IMPLEMENTATION

### 3.1 Class Architecture
**TrieNode Class (trie/trie_node.py):**
- Encapsulates character, children dictionary, terminal flag, and frequency
- Uses `__slots__` for memory optimization

**Trie Class (trie/trie.py):**
- Main data structure with methods: `insert()`, `search()`, `delete()`, `clear()`
- Advanced features: `search_with_wildcard()`, `restore_best_match()`

### 3.2 OOP Principles Demonstrated
**Encapsulation:** Private data members accessed through public methods with input validation

**Composition:** Trie contains multiple TrieNode objects; TrieNode contains dictionary of child nodes

**Polymorphism:** 
- `insert()` method handles both single words and word-frequency pairs
- Search methods support exact matches and wildcard patterns
- File operations adapt to multiple formats

**Method Overloading:**
```python
trie.insert("word")           # Default frequency = 1
trie.insert("word", 5)        # Explicit frequency  
trie.insert("word", frequency=10)  # Named parameter
```

## 4. DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Primary Data Structure: Prefix Trie

**Structure:** Tree-based where each node represents a character, paths represent words, terminal nodes store frequencies, children stored in dictionaries for O(1) access.

**Time Complexity:**
| Operation | Complexity | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Insert | O(M) | M = word length, single path traversal |
| Search | O(M) | M = word length, single path traversal |
| Delete | O(M) | M = word length, path traversal + cleanup |
| Display | O(N*M) | N = words, M = avg length, DFS traversal |

**Space Complexity:** O(ALPHABET_SIZE * N * M) optimized through shared prefixes

### 4.2 Key Algorithms

**Wildcard Matching:**
- Algorithm: Recursive DFS with backtracking
- Time: O(ALPHABET_SIZE^W * N) where W = wildcards, N = nodes
- Handles multiple '*' wildcards with result deduplication

**Levenshtein Distance (Bryan's Feature 1):**
- Algorithm: Dynamic Programming
- Time: O(m*n), Space: O(m*n)
- Maximum edit distance threshold: 2 for practical suggestions

**Auto-Complete (Joel's Feature 1):**
- Algorithm: DFS with early termination  
- Time: O(P + K) where P = prefix length, K = results
- Frequency-based ranking with configurable limits

### 4.3 Data Structure Justification
**Why Trie over alternatives:**
- Hash Table: No prefix/wildcard support
- BST: No natural prefix support, complex wildcards
- Array/List: O(n) search, no prefix optimization

Trie provides natural prefix support, efficient wildcards, memory sharing, frequency ranking, and scales for large vocabularies.
