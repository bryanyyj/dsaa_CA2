1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

1.1 Project Overview
Our application, "ST1507 DSAA: Predictive Text Editor", is designed to help the town 
council of Heatherthorn County restore deteriorated newspaper editions from the 1950s 
and 1960s. The application uses prefix trie data structures to perform predictive text 
analysis and restore damaged text where OCR (Optical Character Recognition) has failed 
to identify characters (marked with asterisk '*').

1.2 Core Functionality
The application provides two main operational modes:
- Construct/Edit Trie: Build and manage prefix tries with keyword insertion, deletion, 
  search, and file I/O operations
- Predict/Restore Text: Restore damaged text using wildcard matching and frequency-based 
  word prediction

Additionally, four extra features enhance the application's capabilities:
- Bryan's Feature 1: Typo Correction Suggestions using Levenshtein distance
- Bryan's Feature 2: Enhanced Pattern Search with regex-like functionality
- Joel's Feature 1: First & Last Word Auto-Complete
- Joel's Feature 2: Top N Most Frequent Words analysis

================================================================================
3. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

3.1 Class Architecture Overview
Our application demonstrates comprehensive OOP principles through a well-structured class hierarchy:

3.1.1 Core Classes:

TrieNode Class (trie/trie_node.py):
- Encapsulation: Private data members (char, children, is_terminal, frequency)
- Represents individual nodes in the trie structure
- Manages character storage and terminal/frequency states

Trie Class (trie/trie.py):
- Main data structure implementing prefix trie functionality
- Methods: insert(), search(), delete(), clear(), get_word_frequency()
- Advanced features: search_with_wildcard(), restore_best_match(), get_keywords()

3.1.2 Class Relationships & Design Patterns:

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER 11: Class diagram showing relationships between Trie, TrieNode, and utility modules]

Composition Pattern:
- Trie class contains multiple TrieNode objects
- TrieNode objects contain dictionaries of child TrieNode objects
- Demonstrates "has-a" relationships effectively

Encapsulation Implementation:
- Private data members protected through method interfaces
- Public methods provide controlled access to internal data
- Input validation and error handling within class methods

3.1.3 Polymorphism Examples:
- insert() method accepts both single words and word-frequency pairs
- search methods handle both exact matches and wildcard patterns
- File I/O operations adapt to multiple file formats

3.1.4 Inheritance Considerations:
While our current implementation doesn't heavily utilize inheritance, the modular design allows for future extension through:
- Specialized trie variants (e.g., CompressedTrie, PersistentTrie)
- Different node types for optimized storage
- Extended search algorithms as subclass methods

3.2 Method Overloading & Function Polymorphism:

insert() Method Variants:
```python
trie.insert("word")           # Default frequency = 1
trie.insert("word", 5)        # Explicit frequency
trie.insert("word", frequency=10)  # Named parameter
```

3.3 Error Handling & Defensive Programming:
- Try-catch blocks for file operations
- Input validation for user commands
- Graceful handling of empty trie states
- Memory management through proper object cleanup

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER 12: Code snippet showing error handling implementation]

================================================================================
4. DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

4.1 Primary Data Structure: Prefix Trie

4.1.1 Structure Description:
Our trie implementation uses a tree-based structure where:
- Each node represents a character
- Paths from root to terminal nodes represent complete words
- Terminal nodes store word frequencies
- Children are stored in dictionaries for O(1) character access

4.1.2 Space Complexity Analysis:
- Space Complexity: O(ALPHABET_SIZE * N * M)
  Where N = number of words, M = average word length
- Optimized through shared prefixes (e.g., "car", "card", "care" share "car" prefix)
- Memory efficiency demonstrated with common English word prefixes

4.1.3 Time Complexity Analysis:

Operation | Time Complexity | Justification
----------|-----------------|---------------
Insert    | O(M)           | M = word length, traverse each character once
Search    | O(M)           | M = word length, single path traversal
Delete    | O(M)           | M = word length, path traversal + cleanup
Display   | O(N*M)         | N = total words, M = average length (DFS traversal)

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER 13: Performance comparison table with different data structure alternatives]

4.2 Algorithm Implementation Details:

4.2.1 Wildcard Matching Algorithm:
```
Function: wildcard_match(trie, pattern)
Algorithm: Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)
Time Complexity: O(ALPHABET_SIZE^W * N)
Where W = number of wildcards, N = nodes visited

Pseudocode:
1. If pattern complete and node is terminal, add to results
2. If current character is '*', explore all children
3. If normal character, follow specific path
4. Return frequency-sorted results
```

4.2.2 Levenshtein Distance Algorithm (Bryan's Feature 1):
```
Function: levenshtein_distance(string1, string2)
Algorithm: Dynamic Programming
Time Complexity: O(m * n)
Space Complexity: O(m * n)

Implementation:
- 2D DP table for edit distance calculation
- Supports insertions, deletions, and substitutions
- Optimized for typo correction suggestions
```

4.2.3 Auto-Complete Algorithm (Joel's Feature 1):
```
Function: autocomplete_prefix(trie, prefix, limit)
Algorithm: DFS with early termination
Time Complexity: O(P + K)
Where P = prefix length, K = number of results up to limit

Process:
1. Navigate to prefix endpoint
2. DFS from prefix node
3. Collect terminal nodes up to limit
4. Sort by frequency descending
```

4.3 Data Structure Comparison & Justification:

4.3.1 Alternative Structures Considered:

Hash Table:
- Pros: O(1) average search time
- Cons: No prefix support, no wildcard matching, higher memory usage
- Verdict: Unsuitable for predictive text requirements

Binary Search Tree:
- Pros: O(log n) operations, sorted output
- Cons: No natural prefix support, complex wildcard implementation
- Verdict: Less efficient for string operations

Array/List:
- Pros: Simple implementation, low overhead
- Cons: O(n) search time, no prefix optimization
- Verdict: Unacceptable for large datasets

4.3.2 Why Trie is Optimal:
- Natural prefix support for auto-completion
- Efficient wildcard pattern matching
- Memory sharing for common prefixes
- Frequency-based ranking capability
- Scalable for large vocabularies

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER 14: Performance benchmarks comparing trie vs. other data structures]

4.4 Built-in Python Data Structures Usage:

Dictionary (dict):
- Usage: Storing child nodes in TrieNode
- Justification: O(1) character lookup, dynamic sizing
- Alternative considered: List (rejected due to sparse character space)

List:
- Usage: Collecting search results, storing word collections
- Justification: Dynamic sizing, easy sorting/filtering
- Memory efficiency: Appropriate for result sets

String:
- Usage: Word representation, pattern matching
- Justification: Immutable, built-in methods for text processing
- Operations: split(), strip(), lower(), capitalize()

Set:
- Usage: Character set matching in enhanced pattern search
- Justification: O(1) membership testing, duplicate elimination

4.5 Algorithm Optimization Techniques:

4.5.1 Early Termination:
- Auto-complete stops at specified limit
- Search terminates on first mismatch
- Pattern matching prunes impossible branches

4.5.2 Frequency-Based Ranking:
- Results sorted by frequency (most common first)
- Improves user experience with better suggestions
- Reduces cognitive load in selection process

4.5.3 Memory Management:
- Lazy deletion (mark as non-terminal instead of removing nodes)
- Shared prefix storage reduces redundancy
- Efficient cleanup in node removal operations
