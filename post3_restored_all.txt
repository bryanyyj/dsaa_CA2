Lost hens finally reunited ['with','such','each','much','both'] rightful owner

Wickbridge 8th August:
The saga of Wickbridge's missing egg-laying hens has finally come to an end, and ['a','i']
happy ending it is. The ['who','two','too'] hens were reported missing ['by','my'] John Brownshell from
Wickbridge village on late Tuesday evening. Heatherthorn's police were called in, and
thanks to police dog Sally's acute sense of smell, the law enforcers ['more','here','were','fire'] swiftly led to
the neighbouring village of Reeshburg, where in the wee hours of 7th August the two
brown hens were found in the warm comfort, of Farmer Snoiterhill's farmstead. The
hens were ['with','both'] in good condition, ['however'] egg laying ['may'] be kept on hold for a ['while','whole'],
as the police brought the two lucky avians ['back'] to Wickbridge in an emotional reunion
with their rightful owner.
